having no one in life is desperation to extremety
tried to prupose her, lost her even as a friend...
tried to love my people atleast, lost everyone too,
finding excuses to be happy being a servant, sincere

Hoping some day someone will listen, but to vain
silence is the only thing i can get piece in
silence is the only thing i can perform
listen to everyone as a kid, gives nothing back to me

faking the greatness, that too in imperfection
faking the happiness, and i know you listen
words being clear and sharp trying to make things up
I have seen you listen, at my cry at once

smart is you, is what i have seen
just it's covered by uncertainty, if not for you, atleast for me
difficult it is to make you up again to me,
all i want is to cheer you up back to me again


failing each time you come to me
i know you also feel the same,
if not, this things at all should not hurt,
afterall I am just a mad guy faking around things

a thousands misshappinings, I have done to you
as an overconfident boy and truthless
harder it is to make all things all right.
all i want is you to be mine , 

I know you are true too, just things are different.
perhaps time will heal us too..
if not you, atleast to me.
else this mad guy, will make everything alright..
